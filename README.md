# Decimal-and-BCD-Calculator
Using ATMEGA16 Microcontroller and C language to create a Calculator for both Decimal and BCD numbers. this was a university project to design a system using ATMEGA16 and C language to create a calculator with main operators that can calculate both Decimal and BCD numbers.

## How to use the project
Since it was a university project, there is a simulation config(the .pdsprj file) that you can use to run the code and see the outcome. To do that, follow these instructions:
> 1. Install proteus app on your computer
> 2. Load the project(open .pdsprj file)
> 3. Select ATMEGA16 unit and upload the .C code (specify the location of .C file)
> 4. Run the simulation

Finally to toggle between the Decimal and BCD just press the lower right button.
